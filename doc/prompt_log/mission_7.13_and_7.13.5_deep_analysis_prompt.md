# Mission 7.13 and 7.13.5 Deep Analysis Prompt

now i will write you what i wrote to chatgpt llm for building and creating missions 7.13 and 7.13.5. i want you to read and understand all those missions from our missions file and make deep analysis (do not create any audit file just tell me write your analysis after), so make deep analyse about the execution of all the needed implementation about those missions. now i will also write you what chatgpt llm wrote me about his implementation and after you understood what we supposed to build according to the missions file, what chatgpt really implemented and now examine what he said we still missing or need to update or enchase so our system will function using all the best practises specific for our system. you need to make all of those deep investigate and anlyse as the best full stack developer that did many years of backebd developer with industry production ready systems. now you also have deep expertise in big orchestrations agents systems that also using or act like mcpr servers or clients and you know exactly the best practises of how ti integrate those mcp servers and all agents into some fully production ready working system.

## How This Prompt Helps

This prompt provides clear direction to:

1. **Understand Mission Requirements**: Read M7.13 (League Orchestration) and M7.13.5 (Automated Cleanup Scheduler) from the official missions document to understand exact requirements and Definition of Done criteria.

2. **Analyze Existing Implementation**: Examine what ChatGPT already implemented in `agents/league_manager/server.py` to verify completeness against mission specifications.

3. **Review Best Practice Recommendations**: Evaluate ChatGPT's architectural guidance about async orchestration, config-driven defaults, repo-backed state, and cleanup patterns.

4. **Identify Gaps and Enhancements**: Determine what's missing, what needs refactoring to meet production-ready standards, and what architectural improvements align with the system's MCP agent orchestration patterns.

5. **Production-Ready Focus**: Apply backend development best practices for distributed agent systems, ensuring thread-safe orchestration, proper error handling, config-driven behavior, and observability through structured logging.

This systematic approach ensures the League Manager meets all mission requirements while following architectural patterns established in the codebase.
